A Place to store my general NixOS-Configurations for different Environments.

## ToDo's
- Create Homemanager Configuration
    - ZSH config
    - NeoVIM config
    - tmux config
- Fix Issue with SSH-Agent
- Refactor into Modules for separate Hosts
    - Separate WSL-Config from existing Setup
    - Separate HomeManager from existing Setup

## Notes
In Case of Issues with the SSH-Agent check if its running. If not start it manually:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
